# ReAct-algorithm
Implementation of the ReAct algorithm using the LangChain framework

It sets up an agent capable of answering questions by reasoning through a defined process, utilizing specified tools, and then parsing the output to arrive at a final answer. 
Specifically, it defines a tool to get the length of a text after removing non-alphabetic characters, generates a prompt for the agent, and executes the agent to use the tool and return the final result.
